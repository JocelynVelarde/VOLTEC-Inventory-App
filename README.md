# VOLTEC Inventory Multiplatform App

- Multi-platform application designed to address the inventory management challenges faced by the robotics team at school. 
- Used Flutter framework, which allows the creation of cross-platform applications for Android and iOS using a single codebase. The programming language Dart (object-oriented), is utilized to create custom components known as Widgets.
- The app uses Firebase for authentication and Google Sheets API for data integration, it provides interactive Widgets for efficient inventory control. Key features include error handling, 3D visualization, and a bug reporting mechanism.
